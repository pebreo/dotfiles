Using the .bash_profile and .bashrc files (~/.bash*)
----------------------------------------
* Mac OS X uses the `.bash_profile` file 
* Ubuntu uses `.bashrc` file (but the `.profile` is invoked first) 
* Windows Git Bash program uses `.bashrc` which should be located in your `c:\Users\Me\` folder. 


Using the .ssh config files (~/.ssh/config)
--------------------------
1. Generate public & private ssh keys:
          `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
    Type in a name which will be put in `~/.ssh` directory

2. To bypass password prompt, you should add the `foo.pub` file to the `authorized_keys` file on the
server's `~/.ssh` directory. You can do a pipe via ssh:
    
    `cat mykey.pub | ssh myuser@mysite.com -p 123 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys' `

3. Add the publickey name to the `~/.ssh/config` file like this:

        Host bitbucket.org
          IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myprivatekeyfile # the leading spaces are important!
          Port 123

4. Verify and then SSH into the remote server. To check if your config is right type: `ssh -T git@github.com`
      
        ssh root@mysite.com
        or
        ssh mysite.com # if you setup the User setting in config

SSH and SFTP for Windows
-----------------------
For Windows, you can use either Putty or OpenSSH to do SSH and Git pushes.
If you're using Putty for SSH and SFTP, you must run Pageant (included in Putty) as the SSH key manager.
Pageant runs in the system tray and is called whenever an SSH key is needed by your system. 

If you're using OpenSSH (included when install Git for Windows) you must setup your ssh keys like
in Unix systems (see above instructions). You run OpenSSH in the Git Bash window.

For SFTP, I recommend using WinSCP because you can easy do file synchronizations as you edit your file on your local machine.

Possible problems from text files saved from Windows
----------------------------------------------------
If the dotfiles are giving you errors then you should install tofrodos:

```    
sudo apt-get install tofrodos
```
then convert your file from dos
```
fromdos myfile
```

Github setup
--------------
Make sure when you create a repo that you set the remote using SSH like this
`git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/username/repo.git # not HTTPS!`

and make sure that your `config` file has the following:
```
Host github.com
 Hostname ssh.github.com
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myprivatekeyfile
 User myuser
 Port 443
```
To check whether your `config` is properly setup for Github, type the following:
`ssh -T git@github.com` 
You should get the following response:
`You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.`

Git repo commands
-----------------
```
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin ssh://github.com/USERNAME/REPONME.git

ssh -T git@github.com
```

Windows setup for Python 2 and 3
-------------------------------
If you want Python 3 and 2 to work side-by-side, you must take the following steps:

1. Install Python 3.3 using MSI binary installer
2. Make an alias like this `alias python3='py -3'` in your `~/.bashrc`
3. Add the `unset PYTHONPATH` command to your `.bashrc` file so that `py -3` can work

Brew + pyenv Mac setup
---------------------
```
brew install pyenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenvwrapper
```
In the `.zshrc`
```
# virtualenvwrapper stuff
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
export PROJECT_HOME=$HOME/Devel
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_SCRIPT=/usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
alias apb=ansible-playbook
export PYENV_ROOT=$HOME/.pyenv
export PATH=$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
export PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

```
Update pyenv
------------
```
brew update
brew upgrade pyenv
```



Sublime shortcut for Mac terminal
---------------------------------
```
# Sublime 2
sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime\ Text\ 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/

# Sublime 3
sudo ln -s /Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl /usr/local/bin/
```
